# Put the JavaScript code you write in this folder

We recommend you separate the implementation details for individual visualizations using the [Reusable Charts](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/) framework Mike Bostock advocates.
Broadly this means implementing visualizations as closures with getter-setter methods.
This can be further extended to [making updatable charts](https://www.toptal.com/d3-js/towards-reusable-d3-js-charts).
